[1] "Random forest cross-validation analysis is complete. Look at the plot of mean cross-validation error across feature counts to determine how many features are needed to minimize prediction error while keeping the feature count as low as possible. This feature count will be used in the following master regulator analysis to pick out that number of putative master regulators (MRs) for your phenotype of interest."
